.SH NAME
G.A.B.I. - Get All Back Immediately - is a tool to undelete an (accidentally)
deleted files from ext2/ext3 file systems

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gabi

\fBgabi --help\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
G.A.B.I. is a wrapper to either PhotoRec or foremost (whichever is found on
your system). Though you could use any of these both programs directly, Gabi
at least eases dealing with command line parameters for foremost.

Another benefit is that Gabi helps you locating the device (in opposite to the
directory) the lost files reside on, and hands this devices name, together with
some other options, to the called tool (i.e. PhotoRec or foremost) - after
making sure the user selected a device different than this to store the
recovered files to.

.SH "CONFIGURATION"
Some basic configuration can be done inside the script, where you will find the
"[ Configuration ]" section at the top - together with a description on what
they do.

.SH MESSAGES AND EXIT CALLS
G.A.B.I. uses exit codes according to the Linux specifications (see
http://rute.2038bug.com/node7.html.gz, section 4.2). Basically these are here:

.TP
Code
Description
.TP
0
Everything went fine - or the user (= you) decided to answer "N" to some question
on whether to continue
.TP
1
Operation not permitted (e.g. script run without root privileges)
.TP
2
Some file was not found

.P
Except for those, error codes from other programs called (such as PhotoRec or
foremost) are simply returned by the script as well.
