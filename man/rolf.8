.SH NAME
R.O.L.F. - Recover One Lost File, a tool to undelete an (accidentally) deleted file
from ext2/ext3 file systems

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rolf
.RB \fIfileName\fR

\fBrolf --help\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
R.O.L.F. is a wrapper to a collection of tools needed for successfully recovery
of files deleted from ext2/ext3 file systems. If you simply want to restore \fBall\fR
deleted files from the entire file system, you better use tools like PhotoRec or
foremost directly (they simply restore everything they find, and you can restrict
by file types and file system only). Using tools like fls, fsstat and dls from the
Sleuthkit, we can restrict further - and that's what Rolf does.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB--help\fR
Display some help (list syntax and available options) and exit.

.SH "CONFIGURATION"
Some basic configuration can be done inside the script, where you will find the
"[ Configuration ]" section at the top - together with a description on what
they do.

.SH MESSAGES AND EXIT CALLS
R.O.L.F. uses exit codes according to the Linux specifications (see
http://rute.2038bug.com/node7.html.gz, section 4.2). Basically these are here:

.TP
Code
Description
.TP
0
Everything went fine - or the user (= you) decided to answer "N" to some question
on whether to continue
.TP
1
Operation not permitted (e.g. script run without root privileges)
.TP
2
Some file was not found

.P
Except for those, error codes from other programs called (such as PhotoRec or
foremost) are simply returned by the script as well.

.SH "FILES"
/usr/bin/rolf
