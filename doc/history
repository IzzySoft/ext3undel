History for ext3undel
=====================

v0.1.5
-------------------
! PhotoRec version check failed for versions <6 (thanks to Christophe to point
  this out and provide the fix)
! when recovery failed, G.A.B.I. always said it was foremosts fault (even though
  PhotoRec may have been used) - again thanks to Christophe
+ added support for PhotoRecs wholespace/freespace feature (see man pages for
  details)
! mount points have not been detected correctly if their "device path" was too
  long (and thus caused wrapped lines in df output)
! using a "WIP" version of PhotoRec (e.g. 6.10-WIP), the scripts failed at the
  version check (minor version '10-WIP' not numeric)

v0.1.4 (01.07.2008)
-------------------
+ ralf now checks the file extension to determine the file type to recover.
  After user confirmation, it makes sure this type is included (photoRec <6.9)
  of even restricts it to recover only files of this type (photoRec 6.9+ and
  foremost) if confirmed - otherwise (or if the file type could not been
  determined), recovery of all known file types will be done.
+ if the iNode for the requested file cannot be found by a direct match, ralf
  now offers to substitute the parent directories iNode instead and runs the
  restore with that iNode (instead of recommending to do so manually)
+ added some more optional parameters to ralf (mainly to switch on/off debug
  messages and the like - see man page)

v0.1.3 (25.06.2008)
-------------------
! wildcard matching did not work as expected (tnx to Martintxo to point this
  out). Now they should - as you would expect in the shell ("?" matching a
  single character, "*" matching none or many characters: "r?lf.*" matches
  "ralf.txt" or "rolf.doc" but not "rolf" (due to the dot)
* again tnx to Martintxo: If the iNode is not found, you may try the directory
  the deleted file was in, before recovering the entire disk. Hint added.
+ added new configuration parameters "DEBUG" and "SILENT", so you can tell
  the script how much it should "talk"
+ added manpage for the configuration file (use "man ext3undel.conf" to see)

v0.1.2 (22.06.2008)
-------------------
+ added configuration files - you no longer should edit the scripts themselves
! solved another little problem with the root mountpoint and iNode evaluation
! if one element of the file path was a symlink, ralf did never find the iNode

v0.1.1 (18.06.2008)
-------------------
! syntax error in gabi caused the script to always abort
* made the messages in ralf a bit more clear
+ added support for wildcards to ralf
* safeguarded user input (make sure we get numbers when needed, etc.)
* taking care for the changed cmd line with photoRec 6.9+ (new parameters) in
  ralf (was already done in gabi)

v0.1.0 (14.06.2008)
-------------------
* first public version
